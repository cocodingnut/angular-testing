# Angular Testing

## Requirements and Setup:
1. Clone this project (Angular v14): [https://github.com/lukeyzhong/angular-testing.git](https://github.com/lukeyzhong/angular-testing.git)
2. Read the readme file.
3. Read the tasks below and finish those tasks.
4. Once you finish the assignment, please submit your repo link and assignment in a word document.

## Tasks:
The first test suite will test HTML rendering. The second test suite will test the `getCharacter` method in the service by using `HttpClientTestingModule`.

### In `app.component.ts`, test:
```typescript
describe('AppComponent', () => {
  test('shows fields for "name" and "culture"', () => {});
  test('shows how many books this character made an appearance in', () => {});
  test('shows alias if no name is present', () => {});
});
```

### In `character.service.ts`, test:
```typescript
describe('AppComponent', () => {
  test('shows fields for "name" and "culture"', () => {});
  test('shows how many books this character made an appearance in', () => {});
  test('shows alias if no name is present', () => {});
});
```

### After these four tests:
	1.	What is the code coverage?
	2.	How to improve code coverage for this Angular application?
	3.	What are TDD and BDD and what are the differences between them?
